		<p>We are glad you are here.  We know you can look up all sorts of information on line about alcohol use and abuse.  More than likely, you are on this page because you want to know, in a more personal way, how alcohol use turns into a problem and once it is, what can be done.  Specifically, how can The Rose House help?</p>

		<p>From after work and sporting events to family and friend gatherings; from advertisements on billboard, TV, magazines and on sides of trucks to memes on Facebook, alcohol has been woven into our society.  But when does an individual’s alcohol use go from use to abuse to dependency?  When does alcohol become a problem that needs treatment?  To get some insight into the progression of alcoholism, you may want to look at The Jellinek Model (<a href="dualdiagnosis.org/alcohol-addiction/disease-theory-alcoholism" target="_blank">dualdiagnosis.org</a> or <a href="in.gov/judiciary/ijlap/jellinek.pdf" target="_blank">in.gov/judiciary/ijlap/jellinek.pdf)</a>.</p>

		<p>The Rose House treats women in need of help with recovery from alcoholism.  These women may also have a history of trauma/mental health issues or may be using substances in addition to alcohol.  Women who have suffered from anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder are at higher risk of alcoholism.  Most individuals experiencing alcoholism either have lost or are in the process of losing important things in their life: relationships, employment, educational opportunities, goals/dreams, health, freedom (legal issues).</p>

		<strong>Rose House women may</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>have had a history of treatment episodes but have not been able to maintain sobriety or may have never had treatment</li>
			<li>be stepping directly into our 90 day program from another treatment episode (like a 30 day residential program)</li>
			<li>have experienced a dramatic dive into alcoholism after a period of moderate to heavy social use (i.e. in business environments, in college) or may have had a gradual fall from use to dependency</li>
			<li>have varying degrees of internal or external motivation to change</li>
			<li>either have a strong history of substance abuse in their families or none at all</li>
			<li>be drinking/”partying” socially or may be drinking in isolation (hiding/lying)</li>
			<li>have had trauma (i.e. loss, abuse) that may have contributed to or was actively involved in their use</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Regardless of how strong our women are, alcoholism has hijacked their lives and they and their loved ones want them back.</p>

		<p>The Rose House utilizes a multi-faceted evidenced-based approach to healing addiction and trauma/mental health issues.  Please see the <a href="/program-overview/treatment-approach/">“The Rose House Treatment Approach”</a> section of our website to see how we help women heal - mind, body and spirit.</p>
