		<p>We are glad you are here.  We know you can look up all sorts of information on line about alcohol use and abuse.  More than likely, you are on this page because you want to know, in a more personal way, how alcohol use turns into a problem and once it is, what can be done.  Specifically, how can The Rose House help?</p>

		<p>From after work and sporting events to family and friend gatherings; from advertisements on billboard, TV, magazines and on sides of trucks to memes on Facebook, alcohol has been woven into our society.  But when does an individualâ€™s alcohol use go from use to abuse to dependency?  When does alcohol become a problem that needs treatment?  To get some insight into the progression of alcoholism, you may want to look at The Jellinek Model (<a href="dualdiagnosis.org/alcohol-addiction/disease-theory-alcoholism" target="_blank">dualdiagnosis.org</a> or <a href="in.gov/judiciary/ijlap/jellinek.pdf" target="_blank">in.gov/judiciary/ijlap/jellinek.pdf)</a>.</p>

		<p>The Rose House treats women in need of help with recovery from alcoholism.  These women may also have a history of trauma/mental health issues or may be using substances in addition to alcohol.  Women who have suffered from anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder are at higher risk of alcoholism.  Most individuals experiencing alcoholism either have lost or are in the process of losing important things in their life: relationships, employment, educational opportunities, goals/dreams, health, freedom (legal issues).</p>

		<p>Regardless of how strong our women are, alcoholism has hijacked their lives and they and their loved ones want them back.</p>

		<p>The Rose House utilizes a multi-faceted evidenced-based approach to healing addiction and trauma/mental health issues.  Please see the The Rose House Treatment Approach section of our website to see how we help women heal - mind, body and spirit.</p>
