		<p>Marijuana, or Cannabis, refers to the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa, which contains the psychoactive (mind-altering) chemical delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), as well as other related compounds. This plant material can also be concentrated in a resin called hashish or a sticky black liquid called hash oil. THC is believed to be the main chemical ingredient that produces the psychoactive effect. Marijuana is often smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes (joints), pipes, or water pipes (bongs). People also smoke it in blunts, which are partly or completely emptied cigars filled with marijuana. Marijuana is also mixed in food (edibles) or brewed as tea.</p>

		<p>The short-term effects of marijuana include problems with memory and learning, distorted perception, difficulty in thinking and problem-solving, and loss of coordination. Among youth, heavy cannabis use is associated with cognitive problems and increased risk of mental illness.</p>

		<p>Synthetic cannabinoids are commonly known as “synthetic marijuana,” “K2,” or “spice.” They are often sold in legal retail outlets as “herbal incense” or “potpourri” and are most popular among young people. To mask their intended purpose and avoid Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory oversight, synthetic drugs are labeled “not for human consumption.”</p>
