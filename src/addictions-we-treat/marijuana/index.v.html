			<p>We are glad you are here. We know you can look up all sorts of information on line about marijuana. More than likely, you are on this page because you want to know, in a more personal way, how marijuana use turns into a problem and once it is, what can be done. Specifically, how can The Rose House help?</p>

			<p>The use, sale of and legality of marijuana is a hot and often controversial topic. Our philosophy is that marijuana is a mind altering substance and individuals who want to live a sober lifestyle must abstain from its’ use. </p>

			<p>Marijuana, or Cannabis, refers to the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa, which contains the psychoactive (mind-altering) chemical delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), as well as other related compounds. This plant material can also be concentrated in a resin called hashish or a sticky black liquid called hash oil. THC is believed to be the main chemical ingredient that produces the psychoactive effect. Marijuana is often smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes (joints), pipes, or water pipes (bongs). People also smoke it in blunts, which are partly or completely emptied cigars filled with marijuana. Marijuana is also mixed in food (edibles) or brewed as tea.</p>

			<p>The short-term effects of marijuana include problems with memory and learning, distorted perception, difficulty in thinking and problem-solving, and loss of coordination. Among youth, heavy cannabis use is associated with cognitive problems and increased risk of mental illness.</p>

			<p>Synthetic cannabinoids are commonly known as “synthetic marijuana,” “K2,” or “spice.” They are often sold in legal retail outlets as “herbal incense” or “potpourri” and are most popular among young people. To mask their intended purpose and avoid Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory oversight, synthetic drugs are labeled “not for human consumption.”</p>
			<strong>Rose House women may</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>have had a history of treatment episodes but have not been able to maintain sobriety or may have never had treatment</li>
				<li>think that marijuana was not a problem for them but have experienced medical, cognitive, financial and relationship issues due to use</li>
				<li>be stepping directly into our 3 month program from another treatment episode (like a 30 day residential program)</li>
				<li>have experienced a dramatic dive into substance use or may have had a gradual fall from use to dependency to addiction</li>
				<li>have varying degrees of internal or external motivation to change</li>
				<li>either have a strong history of substance abuse in their families or none at all</li>
				<li>have moved from using one type of substance to another addictive type</li>
				<li>have had trauma (i.e. loss, abuse) that may have contributed to or was actively involved in their use</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Regardless of how strong our women are, addiction has hijacked their lives and they and their loved ones want them back.</p>

			<p>The Rose House utilizes a multi-faceted evidenced-based approach to healing addiction and trauma/mental health issues. Please see <a href="/program-overview/treatment-approach">“The Rose House Treatment Approach”</a> section of our website to see how we help women heal - mind, body and spirit.</p>
