			<p>Process Addictions are defined as issues that do not involve a substance, but are considered problem behaviors. It is the compulsive nature of the behavior that is often indicative of a behavioral addiction. Women seeking treatment at The Rose House often have process addictions and vulnerabilities in addition to substance abuse and mental health concerns. These issues may include <strong>disordered eating, over exercising, sex and love addiction issues, relationship challenges, shopping, and self harm.</strong></p>
			<p>Frequently, women have issues with disordered eating even if they are not experiencing a diagnosed eating disorder. We are able to address and treat this very delicate situation. As a small treatment facility, The Rose House is in tune with the daily health and well being of clients. We meet women where they are and create a treatment plan accordingly.</p>
			<p>Over exercising is often a problem for women struggling with body image. As a gender specific program, we have the ability to address cultural norms and challenges.</p>
			<p>Love and sex addiction, as well as relationship issues, are regularly addressed at The Rose House in individual therapy sessions as well as in group therapy. Learning how to function in relationship is critical to recovery.</p>
			<p>Sometimes The Rose House learns that a client has a history of overspending and excessive shopping. Our clinicians are diligent in determining why a client is engaging in these behaviors and how we can help.</p>
			<p>Self harm or non-suicidal self injury is an issue for some women in treatment. Using evidence based therapies and techniques, the Rose House is able to address these problem behaviors.</p>
			<p>Unlike traditional rehab, The Rose House has the experience to treat many aspects of mental health that do not necessarily involve a substance. The deep trauma work that occurs at The Rose House often serves to heal process addictions. Women get better at The Rose House.</p>
