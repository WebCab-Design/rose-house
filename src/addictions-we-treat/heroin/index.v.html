		<p>We are glad you are here.  We know you can look up all sorts of information on line about opiate use and abuse – whether you are concerned about prescription drug, heroin or other opiate use.  More than likely, you are on this page because you want to know, in a more personal way, how opiate use turns into a problem and once it is, what can be done.  Specifically, how can The Rose House help?

		<p>Opiate use has become an epidemic in the United States.  The relatively new medical field specialty of “Pain Medicine” is one contributing factor to this epidemic.  Individuals who are legitimately prescribed pain medicine (sometimes in great quantities) can be at risk for at first using as prescribed then moving toward “over using” then being unable to control their use – leading to addiction.  It is also a common scenario for some individuals to move from using prescription opiates (whether initially used for pain or for “recreational use”) to use of heroin.  This progression is often due to the high cost and/or inability to access prescriptions medications.</p>

		<p>The Rose House treats women in need of help with recovery from opiate use. These women may also have a history of trauma/mental health issues or may be using other substances in addition to opiates. Most individuals experiencing opiate addiction either have lost or are in the process of losing important things in their life: relationships, employment, educational opportunities, goals/dreams, health, freedom (legal issues).</p>

		<strong>Rose House women may</strong>

		<ul>
			<li>have had a history of treatment episodes but have not been able to maintain sobriety or may have never had treatment</li>

			<li>be stepping directly into our 90 day program from another treatment episode (like a 30 day residential program)</li>

			<li> have experienced a dramatic dive into opiate use or may have had a gradual fall from use to dependency to addiction</li>

			<li>have varying degrees of internal or external motivation to change</li>

			<li>either have a strong history of substance abuse in their families or none at all</li>

			<li>have moved from using pain medication (legitimately or not) to heroin use</li>

			<li>have had trauma (i.e. loss, abuse) that may have contributed to or was actively involved in their use</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Regardless of how strong our women are, opiate use has hijacked their lives and they and their loved ones want them back.</p>

		<p>The Rose House utilizes a multi-faceted evidenced-based approach to healing addiction and trauma/mental health issues.  Please see <a href="/program-overview/treatment-approach/">“The Rose House Treatment Approach”</a> section of our website to see how we help women heal - mind, body and spirit.</p>
