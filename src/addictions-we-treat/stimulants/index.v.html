		<p>We are glad you are here.  We know you can look up all sorts of information on line about stimulant use and abuse.  More than likely, you are on this page because you want to know, in a more personal way, how stimulant use turns into a problem and once it is, what can be done.  Specifically, how can The Rose House help?</p>

		<p>Stimulants make people more alert, increase their attention, and raise their blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. Stimulants come in a variety of forms, including amphetamines, cocaine, and methamphetamines. Prescription medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are also often stimulants. Improper use of stimulants (other than when used as prescribed by a doctor) can lead to hostility, paranoia, and even psychotic symptoms. Improper stimulant use can also result in unsafely elevated body temperature, irregular heartbeat, heart failure, and seizures.</p>

		<strong>Rose House women may</strong>

		<ul>
			<li>have had a history of treatment episodes but have not been able to maintain sobriety or may have never had treatment</li>
			<li>be stepping directly into our 90 day program from another treatment episode (like a 30 day residential program)</li>
			<li>have experienced a dramatic dive into substance use or may have had a gradual fall from use to dependency to addiction</li>
			<li>have varying degrees of internal or external motivation to change</li>
			<li>either have a strong history of substance abuse in their families or none at all</li>
			<li>have moved from using one type of substance to another addictive type</li>
			<li>have had trauma (i.e. loss, abuse) that may have contributed to or was actively involved in their use</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Regardless of how strong our women are, stimulant use has hijacked their lives and they and their loved ones want them back.</p>

		<p>The Rose House utilizes a multi-faceted evidenced-based approach to healing addiction and trauma/mental health issues. Please see <a href="/program-overview/treatment-approach/">“The Rose House Treatment Approach”</a> section of our website to see how we help women heal - mind, body and spirit.</p>
