			<p>Women entering treatment often have a Personality Disorder diagnosis in addition to their addiction issues. Women are reported to have Personality Disorders more often than men and greatly benefit from being in a gender specific environment. Experienced clinicians at The Rose House are able to help clients manage symptoms and return to emotional stability.</p>
			<p>Some examples of Personality Disorders may include <strong>Borderline Personality Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, Dependent Personality Disorder, and Histrionic Personality Disorder</strong>. The most common personality disorder that women are diagnosed with is Borderline Personality Disorder, characterized by feeling empty, having angry outbursts, unstable mood, and other symptoms. Avoidant Personality Disorder is defined by isolation, keeping distance from peers and activities, and worrying about what others may think of them. Someone with Dependent Personality Disorder is defined as a passive individual that relies on others to help them make decisions. In Histrionic Personality Disorder, there can be a pattern of dramatic, extremely emotional, attention seeking behaviors. While in rehab, clients learn to mange their Personality Disorder Diagnosis.</p>
			<p>At The Rose House, we see most of these disorders as a manifestation of untreated Trauma. Our deep trauma work helps women manage the symptoms of Personality Disorders. Using an integrative, nurturing, and evidence based approach, we give women the skills they need to create the life they want for themselves. Women get better at The Rose House.</p>
