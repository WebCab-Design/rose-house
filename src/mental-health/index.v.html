		<p>Many women who become addicted to drugs and/ or alcohol have underlying trauma and mental health issues. We think trauma as anything that is less than nurturing. Traumas may include abuse, neglect, experiencing a tragic event, growing up in a dysfunctional family or experiencing grief and loss. Mental health symptoms may include depression, anxiety, anger and mood dysregulation. The Rose House provides intensive treatment focused on these underlying issues, believing that their resolution is critical to women maintaining long-term sobriety from substances.</p>

		<p>Dual Diagnosis, sometimes called co-occurring disorders, is a term used to describe individuals who suffer from both one or more substance use disorders and one or more emotional/psychiatric conditions.  To fully recover, the person needs integrated treatment for both issues.  The Diagnostic Statistics Manual 5 (DSM 5) provides professionals the specific criteria that need to be met in order for a person to be given behavioral health diagnoses.  Information regarding substance abuse and mental health diagnoses can be obtained from reputable resources including <a href="www.dsm5.org">www.dsm5.org</a> and <a href="www.samhsa.gov">www.samhsa.gov</a>.</p>

		<p>The Rose House offers women 30 hours per week of individual and group treatment focused specifically on healthy coping and relapse prevention skills, trauma/mental health symptom management, grief and loss, and relationship/sex/love addiction.  Our approach leads to increased self-esteem and self-worth, and motivation to live a healthy, sober lifestyle going forward.</p>

		<p>Our multi-faceted, evidence-based dual diagnosis treatment approach heals women mind, body and spirit.  Women get better here.</p>
