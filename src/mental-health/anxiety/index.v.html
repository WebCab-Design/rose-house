		<p>Many of our women experience anxiety – whether it be a long-standing biological issue or anxiety caused by situations such as stress, loss or repercussions from addiction.  There are medications available to treat anxiety and if these are necessary, our Medical Director is available to support this intervention.</p>

		<p>At The Rose House, our goal is to treat anxiety through having women implement numerous, effective coping skills, limiting medication if possible.  By reducing shame and guilt through treatment of addiction, family issues, trauma, and grief and loss, our women consistently find a significant decrease in symptoms of anxiety and experience increased self-esteem, health and wellness.</p>
