		<p>Some of our women may have had the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, indicating they have suffered from both depression and mania or hypomania (elevated mood) to various degrees.  Medications may be indicated for women with this diagnosis.  There are other effective treatment methods as well.</p>

		<p>At The Rose House, our goal is to treat mental health symptoms by teaching effective coping skills.  In the event medication is necessary, our Medical Director is available to support this intervention.</p>

		<p>By reducing shame and guilt through treatment of addiction, family issues, trauma, and grief and loss, our women consistently find relief from mental health symptoms and experience increased self-esteem, health and wellness.</p>
