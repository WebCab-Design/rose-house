			<p>Research shows that the longer individuals who struggle with addiction and co-occurring disorders participate in appropriate levels of drug and <a href="/addictions-we-treat/alcohol">alcohol addiction</a> treatment, the greater the chances of long term sobriety, health and life fulfillment. Our focus on multi-faceted evidence-based treatment transforms women cognitively, physically, emotionally and spiritually. The growth we see is significant, and we also realize that what our women do after they leave our three month residential program is crucial to their continued recovery.</p>
			<p>After approximately two months at The Rose House, women may enter into the Transition Phase of treatment. Certain milestones must be reached for this phase to be implemented. In the Transition Phase, women are given a bit more freedom and responsibility – to start testing out the waters in “real life” while still in our supportive environment. During this phase, usually in the third month at The Rose House, women begin to plan, with their therapist, for their discharge. This may include getting a part time job and researching next level-of-care options.</p>
			<p>After graduation, <a href="/">The Rose House</a> recommends women step down to our sober living/ continued treatment option for six months. Step Down includes many services and is a great way for women to return to independent living. Women continue to be supported by staff and other women who have gotten to know each other closely over the course of treatment at the Rose House. Our step down program is only available to clients who have completed the Rose House residential program. Step down services include:</p>

			<ul class="c">
				<li>Individual therapy once a week with a Rose House therapist.</li>
				<li>Group therapy a minimum of 4 times a week (Step Down clients are required to attend at least 4 groups a week, but are encouraged to attend as many groups as they would like at the Rose House).</li>
				<li>Women in our step down are working/volunteering or going to school 20 hours a week (Otherwise, they are required to attend more groups at the main house).</li>
				<li>Continued Case Management (career development, budgeting, balancing schedules, life skills, hobbies, etc.)</li>
				<li>Continued support from nurse and doctor with medication management and refills.</li>
				<li>Regular drug/alcohol testing.</li>
				<li>Nightly curfew/well checks by staff</li>
				<li>Health club membership</li>
				<li>24/7 professional support from staff as needed</li>
				<li>Community of supportive women in recovery</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Women are also required to attend a 12 step meeting every day, have a service position and work with a sponsor. The step down houses are located in downtown Lafayette. The town of Lafayette is a vibrant, fun community about five minutes from the main Rose House. </p>
			<p>Regardless of whether our women continue to live nearby after leaving The Rose House, or move out-of-state, we work hard to develop a plan with them that includes the appropriate therapeutic level-of-care and community support. Ideally, The Rose House treatment plan is nine months, including three months in residential and six months at our Step Down. The extended care <a href="../treatment-approach">treatment approach</a> is evidence based and the most effective form of rehab available. Women get better at The Rose House.</p>
