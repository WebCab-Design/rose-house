		<strong>Holistic/Intregrative approach</strong>

		<p>Treating the whole person is vital to long term sobriety and wellness. At The Rose House, we treat the whole person using psychological, emotional, spiritual, physical and medical approaches.  Using evidence-based approaches including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Equine Therapy, Advanced Emotional Regulation, Art Therapy, Grief and Loss treatment and Inner Child work, we treat addiction, trauma, depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders.  We also incorporate daily exercise as well as weekly yoga, meditation and acupuncture. There is a strong relapse prevention component into our program, having each client participate in a 12-step program every evening. Our clients also volunteer in our community. Women learn to count their blessings, increase their self-esteem and decrease feelings of entitlement by feeding the homeless every week. The Rose House has a Medical Director (psychiatrist) on staff to address the medication aspect of treatment.</p>
		<p>Ongoing treatment and support is necessary for women who graduate the Rose House. For more on aftercare options, please <a href="../aftercare/">Click HERE</a>.</p>
