		<h3>The Rose House Story</h3>
		<p>Marcie Chambers, PhD is Founder and CEO of the Rose House. This is her story:</p>

		<p>I started college at the age of 30 as a high school drop-out and single mother of two children, ages 2 and 3.  By the time I had turned 41,  I was a recovering alcoholic and had completed my PhD in Psychology. Shortly thereafter, I went into private practice, working primarily with adolescents and families. In 2001 my daughter, Brittney Rose, died after taking an ecstasy pill that was given to her at her 16th birthday party. A common side effect of ecstasy is the need to drink a lot of water. Though not always fatal, my daughter consumed too much water in a short period of time, which lead to brain swelling.  Shortly thereafter, she passed away.</p>

		<p>The experience was traumatic and I quit working for a while. The grief was devastating. When I got back on my feet, I began teaching at the university level and my private practice shifted from focusing on adolescents to more general psychology.  I was working with a young woman who clearly needed treatment for alcohol and drug addiction.  Knowing that a 30 day treatment program was a great start, but not nearly enough to sustain long-term sobriety, I referred her to a 30 day addiction treatment program and then to an extended care facility in California. After some struggles, she did very well and is clean and sober today.</p>

		<p>Young women started to come to me for help and I was inspired by watching them begin to heal.  At that time, Colorado had a few great programs in place for men, but there were no extended care treatment options for women. Women need treatment specific to them that includes trauma treatment, love addiction treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and other evidence based treatment. Treatment for women needs to focus, not only on addiction, but also on the co-occurring disorders and underlying issues that contribute to addiction.</p>

		<p>With the support of local treatment providers and their members, I opened the Rose House in 2008. I named the program after my daughter, thinking that even though I could not save her, I might have a hand in helping save the lives of other daughters. Addiction is a deadly disease. It is a matter of life and death. And along the way, heart ache is experienced by family and friends of alcoholics and addicts.</p>

		<p>Today, the Rose House is a 16 bed facility, housed in a beautiful “prairie mansion” out in the country in Boulder County, Colorado. I am blessed daily with the gift of watching women heal. It is such an amazing thing to watch the transformation of the women as they move from depressed, shameful, scared and often angry emotional states to strong, confident, productive, loving daughters, mothers, sisters, and wives.</p>

		<p>As part of our extended care model we also offer several step down homes that women can transition into after The Rose House. These extended care settings provide a safe and sober living environment and include weekly group and individual therapy sessions, random drug and alcohol screening, health club membership and required part time work or volunteerism.</p>

		<p>When I opened the Rose House I had a vision for helping women recover from alcohol and drugs in a safe, extended care setting. The fulfillment and joy that has followed is unexplainable. The tragedy of losing my daughter has turned into a blessing.</p>
