		<h3>The Rose House Story</h3>
		<p>The following is The Rose House story told from the point-of-view of our founder, Marcie Chambers, PhD:</p>

		<p>I have been asked to put on paper how the Rose House came to be. Here is a brief history of the path that lead me to opening the Rose.</p>

		<p>I am a recovered alcoholic. I started college at age 30 as a high school drop out and single mom when my children were 2 and 3 years old. I earned Bachelors and Masters degrees and completed my PhD in Psychology when I was 41. I went into private practice, working primarily with adolescents and families. In 2001 my daughter, Brittney Rose, died after taking an Ecstasy pill she was given as a gift for her 16th birthday, at her 16th birthday party. She died from drinking too much water in a short period of time, which lead to brain swelling, as apparently Ecstasy makes people really thirsty.</p>

		<p>I pretty much quit working for a while. As you can imagine, the grief was devastating. When I got back on my feet, I began teaching at the university level and my private practice shifted from focusing on adolescents to more general psychology. I was working with a young woman who clearly needed treatment for alcohol/drug addiction. Knowing that a 30 days treatment program was a great start, but not nearly enough to be able to sustain long term sobriety in most cases, I referred her to a 30 day addiction treatment program and then an extended care treatment facility in California. After some struggles, she did very well and is clean and sober and currently working on a Masterʼs degree.</p>

		<p>I started toying with the idea of opening an extended care treatment facility here in Colorado because while there is a great program for men, The Jaywalker Lodge in Carbondale, there wasnʼt anything for women. Women need treatment specific to them that includes trauma treatment, love addiction treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectic behavioral therapy and other evidence based treatment. The treatment for women needs to focus not only addiction, but also on the co-occurring disorders and underlying issues that contribute to addiction.</p>

		<p>With the support of Bobby Ferguson, the founder of Jaywalker, and other members of the treatment community, I opened The Rose in 2008. I named the program after my daughter, thinking that even though I couldnʼt save her, I might have a hand in helping save the lives of other women. Addiction is a deadly disease. It is a matter of life and death. And along the way, heart ache is experienced by family and friends of alcoholics/addicts.</p>

		The original Rose was a 6 bed facility and I was the chief cook and bottle washer. I lived on site and other than a part time addiction counselor, I was the only “employee.” I designed the program, facilitated the groups, conducted individual therapy, took the women to outside 12 step meetings nightly and health club daily, shopped, cooked, you name it.</p>

		<p>Today, The Rose is a 16 bed facility, housed in a beautiful “prairie mansion” out in the country in Boulder County, Colorado. I am blessed daily with the gift of watching women heal. It is such an amazing thing to watch the transformation of the women as they move from depressed, shameful, scared and often angry women to strong, confident, productive, loving daughters, mothers, sisters, and wives.</p>

		<p>We have also opened step down facility homes that the women can move to after The Rose. They provide a safe and sober living environment with weekly group and individual therapy, random drug and alcohol testing, health club membership, etc.</p>


		<p>When I opened The Rose I had a vision of being able to help women. I had no idea or thought of the fulfilling, joyful and challenging life The Rose has given me. Who knew that out of the tragedy of losing my daughter, such a blessing could be born.</p>





		<!-- <p>Marcie Chambers, PhD is Founder and CEO of the Rose House. This is her story:</p>

		<p>I started college at the age of 30 as a high school drop-out and single mother of two children, ages 2 and 3.  By the time I had turned 41,  I was a recovering alcoholic and had completed my PhD in Psychology. Shortly thereafter, I went into private practice, working primarily with adolescents and families. In 2001 my daughter, Brittney Rose, died after taking an ecstasy pill that was given to her at her 16th birthday party. A common side effect of ecstasy is the need to drink a lot of water. Though not always fatal, my daughter consumed too much water in a short period of time, which lead to brain swelling.  Shortly thereafter, she passed away.</p>

		<p>The experience was traumatic and I quit working for a while. The grief was devastating. When I got back on my feet, I began teaching at the university level and my private practice shifted from focusing on adolescents to more general psychology.  I was working with a young woman who clearly needed treatment for alcohol and drug addiction.  Knowing that a 30 day treatment program was a great start, but not nearly enough to sustain long-term sobriety, I referred her to a 30 day addiction treatment program and then to an extended care facility in California. After some struggles, she did very well and is clean and sober today.</p>

		<p>Young women started to come to me for help and I was inspired by watching them begin to heal.  At that time, Colorado had a few great programs in place for men, but there were no extended care treatment options for women. Women need treatment specific to them that includes trauma treatment, love addiction treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and other evidence based treatment. Treatment for women needs to focus, not only on addiction, but also on the co-occurring disorders and underlying issues that contribute to addiction.</p>

		<p>With the support of local treatment providers and their members, I opened the Rose House in 2008. I named the program after my daughter, thinking that even though I could not save her, I might have a hand in helping save the lives of other daughters. Addiction is a deadly disease. It is a matter of life and death. And along the way, heart ache is experienced by family and friends of alcoholics and addicts.</p>

		<p>Today, the Rose House is a 16 bed facility, housed in a beautiful “prairie mansion” out in the country in Boulder County, Colorado. I am blessed daily with the gift of watching women heal. It is such an amazing thing to watch the transformation of the women as they move from depressed, shameful, scared and often angry emotional states to strong, confident, productive, loving daughters, mothers, sisters, and wives.</p>

		<p>As part of our extended care model we also offer several step down homes that women can transition into after The Rose House. These extended care settings provide a safe and sober living environment and include weekly group and individual therapy sessions, random drug and alcohol screening, health club membership and required part time work or volunteerism.</p>

		<p>When I opened the Rose House I had a vision for helping women recover from alcohol and drugs in a safe, extended care setting. The fulfillment and joy that has followed is unexplainable. The tragedy of losing my daughter has turned into a blessing.</p> -->
