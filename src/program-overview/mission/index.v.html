		<h3>The Rose House Story</h3>
		<p>Marcie Chambers, PhD is a recovering alcoholic and founder of the Rose House. This is her story:</p>

		<p>I started college at the age of 30 as a high school drop-out and single mother of two children, they were two and three years old at the time. By the time I had turned 41, I had completed my PhD in Psychology. Shortly thereafter I went into private practice, working primarily with adolescents and families. In 2001 my daughter, Brittney Rose, died after taking Ecstasy pills that were given to her at her 16th birthday party. A common side effect of Ecstasy is the need to drink a lot of water. Though not always fatal, my daughter consumed to much water in a short period of time which lead to her brain swelling and, shortly thereafter, she passed away. </p>

		<p>The experience was traumatic and I quit working for awhile. As you can imagine, the grief was devastating. When I got back on my feet, I began teaching at the university level and my private practice shifted from focusing on adolescents to more general psychology. I was working with a young woman who clearly needed treatment for alcohol/ drug addiction. Knowing that a 30 day treatment program was a great start, but not nearly enough to sustain long-term sobriety, I referred her to a 30 day addiction treatment program and then to an extended care facility in California. After some struggles, she did very well and is clean and sober today.</p>

		<p>Seeing the need for long term treatment and the lack of long-term care in Colorado at the time, I became inspired to open the Rose House. </p>

		<p>It was that very inspiration that followed from watching women begin to heal that I began to consider the possibility of opening an extended care facility after getting back to work following the untimely death of her daughter. At that time, Colorado had a few great programs in place for men, but there were no extended care treatment options for women. Women need treatment specific to them that includes trauma treatment, love addiction treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectic behavioral therapy, and other evidence based treatment. The treatment for women needs to focus, not only on addiction, but also on the co-occurring disorders and underlying issues that contribute to addiction. </p>

		<p>With the support of local treatment providers and their members, I opened the Rose House in 2008. I named the program after my daughter, thinking that even though I could not save her, I might have a hand in helping saving the lives of others’ daughters. Addiction is a deadly disease. It is a matter of life and death. And along the way, heart ache is experienced by family and friends of alcoholics/ addicts. </p>

		<p>Today, the Rose House is a 16 bed facility, housed in a beautiful “prairie mansion” out in the country in Boulder County, Colorado. I am blessed daily with the gift of watching women heal. It is such an amazing thing to watch the transformation of the women as they move from depressed, shameful, scared and often angry emotional states to strong, confident, productive, loving daughters, mothers, sisters, and wives. </p>

		<p>As part of our extended care model we also offer several step down homes that they women can transition into after the Rose House. These extended care settings provide a safe and sober living environment with weekly group and individual therapy sessions, random drug and alcohol screening, health club membership, etc. </p>

		<p>When I opened the Rose House I had a vision for helping women recover from alcohol and drugs in a safe, extended care setting. The fulfillment and joy that has followed is unexplainable. The tragedy of losing my daughter has turned into a blessing and the Rose House continues to help women find their recovery journey. </p>

		<p>Today, the Rose House is a premiere treatment facility and is staffed by a robust clinical team that is committed to helping women stay sober.</p>
