<h3>The Rose House Story</h3>
<strong><em>The following is The Rose House story told from the point-of-view of our founder, Marcie Chambers, PhD:</em></strong>

<p>I have been asked to put on paper how the Rose House came to be. Here is a brief history of the path that lead me to opening the Rose.</p>

<p>I am a recovered alcoholic. I started college at age 30 as a high school drop out and single mom when my children were 2 and 3 years old. I earned Bachelors and Masters degrees and completed my PhD in Psychology when I was 41. I went into private practice, working primarily with adolescents and families. In 2001 my daughter, Brittney Rose, died after taking an Ecstasy pill she was given as a gift for her 16th birthday, at her 16th birthday party. She died from drinking too much water in a short period of time, which lead to brain swelling, as apparently Ecstasy makes people really thirsty.</p>

<p>I pretty much quit working for a while. As you can imagine, the grief was devastating. When I got back on my feet, I began teaching at the university level and my private practice shifted from focusing on adolescents to more general psychology. I was working with a young woman who clearly needed treatment for alcohol/drug addiction. Knowing that a 30 days treatment program was a great start, but not nearly enough to be able to sustain long term sobriety in most cases, I referred her to a 30 day addiction treatment program and then an extended care treatment facility in California. After some struggles, she did very well and is clean and sober and currently working on a Master ºs degree.</p>
