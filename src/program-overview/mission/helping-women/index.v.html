		<p>Today, the Rose House is a 16 bed facility, housed in a beautiful “prairie mansion” out in the country in Boulder County, Colorado. We have a staff of 13, including three full time therapists. I am blessed daily with the gift of watching women heal. It is such an amazing thing to watch the transformation of the women as they move from depressed, shameful, scared and often angry women to strong, confident, productive, loving daughters, mothers, sisters, and wives.</p>

		<p>As part of our extended care model we also offer several step down facility homes that they women can transition into after the Rose House, including The Rose Garden, The Rose Petal, and the Rose Cottage. These extended care settings provide a safe and sober living environment with weekly group and individual therapy sessions, random drug and alcohol screening, health club membership, etc.</p>

		<p>When Dr. Marcie Chambers opened the Rose House she had a vision for helping women recover from alcohol and drugs in a safe, extended care setting. The fulfillment and joy that has followed is unexplainable. The tragedy of losing her daughter (link italics back to Brittany Rose page) has turned into a blessing and the Rose House continues to help women find their recovery journey.</p>
