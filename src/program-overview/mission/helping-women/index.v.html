<h1>Helping Women Recover</h1>
<p>Today, The Rose is a 16 bed facility, housed in a beautiful “prairie mansion” out in the country in Boulder County, Colorado. We have a staff of 13 which includes 3 full time therapists. I am blessed daily with the gift of watching women heal. It is such an amazing thing to watch the transformation of the women as they move from depressed, shameful, scared and often angry women to strong, confident, productive, loving daughters, mothers, sisters, and wives.</p>

<p>We have also opened The Rose Garden, The Rose Petal, and The Rose Cottage step down facility homes that the women can move to after The Rose. They provide a safe and sober living environment with weekly group and individual therapy, random drug and alcohol testing, health club membership, etc.</p>

<p>When I opened The Rose I had a vision of being able to help women. I had no idea or thought of the fulfilling, joyful and challenging life The Rose has given me. Who knew that out of the tragedy of losing my daughter, such a blessing could be born.</p>
