		<p>Marcie Chambers PhD is a recovering alcoholic and founder of the Rose House and this is her story about how the Rose House came to be:</p>

		<p>I started college at the age of 30 as a high school drop out and single mom when my children were two and three years old. By the time I had turned 41 years old I had completed my PhD in Psychology. Shortly thereafter I went into private practice, working primarily with adolescents and families. In 2001 my daughter, Brittney Rose, died after taking Ecstasy pills that she was given to her at her 16th birthday party. A common side effect of Ecstasy is the need to drink a lot of water. Though not always fatal, my daughter consumed to much water in a short period of time which lead to her brain swelling and, shortly thereafter, she passed away.</p>

		<p>The experience was traumatic and I quit working for awhile. As you can imagine, the grief was devastating. When I got back on my feet, I began teaching at the university level and my private practice shifted from focusing on adolescents to more general psychology. I was working with a young woman who clearly needed treatment for alcohol/ drug addiction. Knowing that a 30 day treatment program was a great start, but not nearly enough to sustain long-term sobriety (in most cases), I referred her to a 30 day addiction treatment program and then to an extended care facility in California. After some struggles, she did very well and is clean and sober today.</p>

		<p>Seeing the need for long term treatment and the lack of long-term care in Colorado at the time, I became inspired to open the Rose House (link italics to Inspiration page).</p>
