<h3>Gaining Inspiration</h3>
<p>I started toying with the idea of opening an extended care treatment facility here in Colorado because while there is a great program for men, The Jaywalker Lodge in Carbondale, there wasnʼt anything for women. Women need treatment specific to them that includes trauma treatment, love addiction treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectic behavioral therapy and other evidence based treatment. The treatment for women needs to focus not only addiction, but also on the co-occurring disorders and underlying issues that contribute to addiction.</p>

<p>With the support of Bobby Ferguson, the founder of Jaywalker, and other members of the treatment community, I opened The Rose in 2008. I named the program after my daughter, thinking that even though I couldnʼt save her, I might have a hand in helping save the lives of other women. Addiction is a deadly disease. It is a matter of life and death. And along the way, heart ache is experienced by family and friends of alcoholics/addicts.</p>

<p>The original Rose was a 6 bed facility and I was the chief cook and bottle washer. I lived on site and other than a part time addiction counselor, I was the only “employee.” I designed the program, facilitated the groups, conducted individual therapy, took the women to outside 12 step meetings nightly and health club daily, shopped, cooked, you name it.</p>
