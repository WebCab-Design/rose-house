		<p>Marcie Chambers PhD began to consider the possibility of opening an extended care facility after getting back to work following the untimely death of her daughter. At that time, Colorado had a few great programs in place for men, but there were no extended care treatment options for women. Women need treatment specific to them that includes trauma treatment, love addiction treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectic behavioral therapy, and other evidence based treatment. The treatment for women needs to focus, not only on addiction, but also on the co-occurring disorders and underlying issues that contribute to addiction.</p>

		<p>With the support of local treatment providers and their members, I opened the Rose House in 2008. I named the program after my daughter, thinking that even though I could not save her, I might have a hand in helping saving the lives of othersâ€™ daughters. Addiction is a deadly disease. It is a matter of life and death. And along the way, heart ache is experienced by family and friends of alcoholics/ addicts.</p>

		<p>The original Rose House was a 6 bed facility and I was the chief cook and bottle washer. I lived on the site and other than a part time addiction counselor, I was the sole employee. I designed the program, facilitated the groups, conducted individual therapy, took the women to outside, nightly 12 step meetings, fitness club, shopped, cooked, you name it.
		Today the Rose House is a premiere treatment facility and is staffed by a robust clinical team that is committed to helping women stay sober (link italics to Helping Women page).</p>
