						<h3>Brother of a Rose House Client</h3>

						<h5>"I had a good visit with my sister this past weekend. She was prospective in all of our conversations. She appeared to accept who she is much more than before. She was open and honest. She did not bring up the past which is a welcomed change. She’s not stuck. She’s able to process so much more information since she’s not in a fog. She discussed her goals and aspirations on succeeding in the program. She has made many friends and really likes her roommate. I’m so glad she identifies with the group and her sober community. That appears to be where she is building her relationships. My sister thinks she’s close to graduating and is looking forward to transitioning to sober living. She really sees herself staying in Boulder for the foreseeable future. You and the staff at Rose House have made remarkable progress with my sister. I can’t thank you enough for investing your time with her."</h5>
