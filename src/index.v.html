	<h3>Rose House Testimonial</h3>
	<hr style="width: 50%;">
	<div class="active">
		<p>"I’ll never forget the day my daughter called and said in an excited voice, “I have one year of sobriety today.” I want to thank all Rose House staff members for everything you all did to help save my daughter… God Bless you all for giving me both my daughter back and my granddaughter her mother back… Life is good!"</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>"My sister is completely invested in the program and believes in the power of the Rose House group therapy sessions… She loves her schedule with the various AA, NA, Al-Anon meetings as well. The Rose House staff has made remarkable progress with my sister. I cannot thank you all enough for investing the time you have with her."</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>"It's Mother's Day, THANK YOU again for saving my daughter's life. I know she did the work herself, but you are responsible for the good job she did!!! I feel for the moms today whose daughter didn't make it. Thank you Marci, her therapist Terri, and all the rest of you! Love to those who have lost their daughter."</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>"It has been one year since my daughter graduated from the Rose House… I will never forget the compassion you showed my daughter…I am hopeful that her life is new and that she has a second chance to do something great with it… This is a day that will be remembered in our home."</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>"Hi Marcie, I am thinking of you! I started teacher training this week for yoga and spin instructing… What I am doing now is so much more than just fitness instruction, it is also soul food… I was so scared to start training, but my life experiences, especially those gained from the Rose House, have lead me to trust in the process… Grateful everyday!"</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>"I wanted to take a few minutes and thank the Rose House staff for all the wonderful things you all did for my daughter… With your help and guidance she has blossomed… She is much more clear, positive, and confident in herself than she has EVER been… Again, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you have done…"</p>
