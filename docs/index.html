						<h3>Rose House Testimonial - Brother</h3>
						<hr style="width: 50%;">
						<h5>"I had a good visit with my sister this past weekend. You mentioned that you thought she had made lots of progress in the past 30 days. I completely agree. She is totally invested in the program. She believes in the power of group therapy. She loves her schedule, her various AA, NA, Al-Anon meetings. She was prospective in all of our conversations. She appeared to accept who she is much more than before. She was open and honest. She did not bring up the past which is a welcomed change. Sheâs not stuck. Sheâs able to process so much more information since sheâs not in a fog. She discussed her goals and aspirations on succeeding in the program. She has made many friends and really likes her roommate. Iâm so glad she identifies with the group and her sober community. That appears to be where she is building her relationships. It was really great to drop-in when her roommate was graduating. My sister thinks sheâs close to graduating and is looking forward to transitioning to sober living. She really sees herself staying in Boulder for the foreseeable future. I think that is a great plan. Sheâll continue to make friends and blossom. You and the staff at Rose House have made remarkable progress with my sister. I canât thank you enough for investing your time with her."</h5>

						<h3>Rose House Testimonial - Mother</h3>
						<hr style="width: 50%;">
						<h5>"It has been one year since my daughter graduated from The Rose House. I want to let you and all of the staff know that I continue to think and pray for all of you, even in your own separate journeys. I also continue to think and pray for every graduate that I know of by name. I will not forget all the compassion you showed my daughter. I am well aware of the times of grief she caused you all. She appears to be doing well now. I continue to see Godâs hand (merciful hand) at work in her life. I am hopeful that her life is new and that she has a second chance to do something great with it. I pray that this second chance will be used to its fullest potential. Again, this day is one remembered in our home. Thank you."</h5>

						<h3>Rose House Testimonial - Client</h3>
						<hr style="width: 50%;">
						<h5>"Hi Marcie! I am thinking of you! I started teacher training this week for yoga and spin instructing, and so much has been reminding me of you and The Rose House. What I am doing now is so much more than just fitness instruction, itâs also soul food. Introspection and working on ourselves in order to be able to give back has been on my mind lately. Itâs been a crazy ride, but I keep finding that the same themes keep coming up for me. I take that as a sign from the Universe to make sure Iâm listening! The theme for me last week was to be open and willing (Honest too!) I was so scared to start training, but my life experiences, especially in your home, have lead me to trust in the process, and that greatly outweighs the fear of the unknown. I just wanted to pop by and say that Iâm forever grateful for you! I also wanted to share this link to this particular Ted Talk. We were assigned to watch it, and it reminded me of dinners at The Rose House. I am remembering to be grateful everyday no matter how big or small."</h5>

						<h3>Rose House Testimonial - Mother</h3>
						<hr style="width: 50%;">
						<h5>"As the holiday season is upon us, I wanted to take a few minutes and thank you for all of the wonderful things you and the Rose House staff have done for my daughter. I am so very grateful for many things in my life, but will never be able to express to you how thankful I am that you have helped her in so many ways. I realize that her journey there has been long, but again, like I say, that is who she is. It takes a long time for her to do anything. With your help and guidance she has blossomed. I understand that her addictions were what landed her in the Rose House in the first place, but the constant work that you do with her with the mental health issue is what will have the lasting affect. She is much more clear, positive, and confident in herself than she has EVER been. It is always such a pleasure to talk to her. I chatted with her yesterday and even though she was sick she still had such clarity. It seems to me that our daughter is really enjoying her job. She tells me how good it is for her because dealing with the general public and the different personalities makes her constantly work on her âshame and guiltâ. I hope you, your family, and friends have a great holiday season, and once again I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you have done, and all you will do in the future for our daughter!"</h5>

						<h3>Rose House Testimonial - Father</h3>
						<hr style="width: 50%;">
						<h5>"My daughter called me yesterday, and said in an excited voice, âGuess what today is?â I told her that I will never forget the date, as it is her one year anniversary of being sober. I know she came back early from the step down facility, but the pressure of not see her daughter became too much for her. Next month my daughter turns 24. She is really growing up into motherhood, and also as a person. She is very proud of her one year of sobriety, and takes her life one day at a time. Most of all, what she learned at the Rose House, she has used to help herself move forward with her life. I know she misses her friends there, and hopes to see some of them later in the year. Thank you Tom, Marcie, and all of the rest of the people at the Rose House for everything that you all did to help save my daughter, and put her back on the right track, during the most difficult time of her life. She has asked me now, âHow can I ever pay you back dad for what you have done for me, and being there for meâ. I told her that if the time ever comes when someone you may know or meet needs help getting their life turned around, just help them. I know today that she would not turn her back in helping someone who has problems like herself. With my daughter going back to college soon, it wouldnât surprise me that she doesnât go into your field, as she has mentioned it several times. God bless you all for giving me, my daughter back, and my granddaughter, her mother back. Life is good, and I pray that yours is to!"</h5>
